# Cypress Test Automation Framework

A test automation framework based on Cypress aligning with the Syntax of Sana test automation framework using YAML for Page Object and Data Driven modelling!

## Web UI test automation

* [Cypress.io](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) - Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser. Runs on Mac, Linux, Windows and any CI.

## Reporting

* [Mochawesome](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome) - reporter for Mocha that generates a full fledged HTML/CSS report that helps visualize your test suites

## Visual Testing

* [Cypress Image Snapshot](https://github.com/palmerhq/cypress-image-snapshot) - Cypress Image Snapshot binds jest-image-snapshot's image diffing logic to Cypress.io commands.

## Installation

npm install - Install Node dependancies
